## Figure 4 - Corin-induced RNA splicing is therapeutic and more efficacious than single agents.
Here, 3 splicing events were validated based on the RNA-seq data and used to compare corin's impact on splicing to MS-275, and GSK-LSD1. Additionally, survival association analysis was conducted to determine if corin induces survival-associated splicing events.
  - `survival_association.Rmd` contains the code used to conduct survival association analysis (TCGA-SKCM) on common corin-induced splicing events in melanoma. 
  - `Therapeutic_Splicing_Datafile.xlsx` contains the raw data for the RT-PCR gels comparing DMSO to Corin for TJP1, MYO1B, and FN1. IT also contains the raw values for the RT-PCR gels comparing DMSO, LSD1i, HDACi, and corin. Lastly, it contains a list of the corin-induced survival-associated genes. 
  - `RT-PCR SKMEL5.pzfx` is the graphpad file used to quantify and do statistical analysis for the RT-PCR gels.
