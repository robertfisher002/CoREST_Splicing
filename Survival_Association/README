Goal: 
See if any of the common corin-induced splicing events are survival-associated in TCGA-SKCM

Method:
- Was going to run a univariate cox regression analysis using overlapped patient survival data from xena and splicing data form TCGA-spliceseq but this reduced the patient population to n=103, so I used this database instead which did splicing analysis using spladder: http://www.oncosplicing.com/
- I downloaded the survival-associated events (p<0.05) and overlapped with 74 common splicing evetns from corin treatment and then plotted the hazard ratios and p values for the 7 events. Then I color coded by inclusion or exclusion to see if they would be protective or harmful splicing events. 
- Had to cross-reference the spladder event exon number with the corin number. Could not use coordinates because oncosplice uses hg19 and our splicing data uses hg38
- Generated KM plots from oncosplice
- Also ran GO analysis for all ~1600 events that were found to be surivival-associated in SKCM

#Results:
- 7 events identified
- FN1 exon 33 was one of the events
- Generated kaplan-meier plots
- Found that actin and cytoskeletal pathways were top hits for SASE in SKCM
