Goal: 
  - Identify corin-induced splicing changes in cancers outside of melanoma (ATRT & Breast Cancer)

Method:
  - Breast cancer corin treated data was collected from GEO (Series GSE168644) with SRAtoolkit
  - ATRT data was from JHU collaboration
  - Splicing changes were identified using RNA-seq BAM files aligned with STAR and rmats-turbo (v4.2) https://github.com/Xinglab/rmats-turbo

Results:
  - Splicing counts
  - PSI boxplots
  - Overlap
  - GO pathway analysis
