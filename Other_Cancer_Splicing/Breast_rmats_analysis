1. Use SRAtoolkit to download fastq files from GEO (**[Series GSE168644](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168644)**) - used the FM T47D DMSO and Corin 72h data because FM stands for full media. The other samples are for something else they were testing
    
    ```bash
    fasterq-dump -p -t /scratch/$USER --outdir fastq SRR13926999 2>&1 | tee out/fasterq-dump.out
    ```
