## Figure 4 - Corin impacts RNA splicing across cancers.
Here, we conducted splicing analysis on ATRT (BT37, CHLA06) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines to determine if corin impacts RNA splicing broadly across cancers.
  - `other_cancer_splice.Rmd` contains the code used to filter splicing events obtained from rMATs and LeafCutter, create the stacked bar plot, generate the venn diagram overlap of melanoma, breast, and ATRT events, Jaccard similarity analysis, and GO dotplots. 
  - `Other_Cancer_Datafile.xlsx` contains significant SE events for each cancer cell line, splicing counts, GSEA pathway analysis files, DEG analysis, and common GO and SE events.
  - `scripts` directory contains the bash scripts for rMATs and LeafCutter analysis.
  - `raw_splicing_files` contains the raw ouptuts (pre-filtered) for rMATs and LeafCutter analysis.
