Goal:
  - Assess if U2AF2 co-localizes with CoREST based on publicly available data from the ENCODE project (HepG2).
  - Also check peak annotations for U2AF2 binding sites

Method:
  - Collected on 1/18-1/19 2024
  LSD1: https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR115BLD/
  HDAC1: https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR362CPB/
  U2AF2: https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR991ADX/
  RCOR1: https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000EDQ/

  -Downloaded default (GrCh38) bigwig & narrow peak IDR filtered bed files from 2020 - see file names for exact version and links above for info on ENCODE ChiP processing pipeline and thresholding.

  -R script to process bed file co-occupancy is located in this folder. It utilizes the ChIPpeakAnno package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/ChIPpeakAnno/inst/doc/ChIPpeakAnno.html) based on GR objects created from the bed files in this directory.

  -Bigwig files were used for IGV track visualization.

  - Peak annotation
    - BED files were sorted using bedtools sortBed: sortBed -i ENCFF556EWI_U2AF2.bed > ENCFF556EWI_U2AF2_sorted.bed
    - BED files were formatted to Homer peak files with chr, start, end, strand (all + because strandedness is not needed), and peak number
    - homer AnnotatePeaks was used to identify gene region enrichment and ontologies for U2AF2 binding sites.

Results:
  - Venn diagram overlap of peaks
  - U2AF2_peaks.bed.txt contains all CoREST-U2AF2 co-occupancy peak locations
