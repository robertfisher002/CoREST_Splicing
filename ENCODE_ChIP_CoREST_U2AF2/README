RCOR1: https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000EDQ/

-Downloaded default (GrCh38) bigwig & narrow peak IDR filtered bed files from 2020 - see file names for exact version and links above for info on ENCODE ChiP processing pipeline and thresholding.

-R script to process bed file co-occupancy is located in this folder. It utilizes the ChIPpeakAnno package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/ChIPpeakAnno/inst/doc/ChIPpeakAnno.html) based on GR objects created from the bed files in this directory.

-Bigwig files were used for IGV track visualization.
