#Contains scripts and data for Figure 2 - corresponds to studies exploring corin's impact on splicing factor gene expression experiment. Here, RNAseq (100M, 150bp) was performed across 6 melanoma cell lines (451Lu, 1205Lu, SKMEL5, SKMEL24, SKMEL28, WM793) treated +/- corin  (24h, 2.5uM). 
  - DEG_heatmap.Rmd contains the code used to do a comparison of corin-induced DEGs, identification of common downregulated pathway, and interrogation of specific downregulated splicing factors. 
  - Expression_datafile.xlsx contains the raw data for Figure 2 (DEGs, GSEA analysis) and outputs for the R script. It also includes raw data for the western blot validation of downregulated splicing factors
