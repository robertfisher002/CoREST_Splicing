## Figure 3 - Corin induces RNA splicing changes in melanoma
Here, RNAseq (100M, 150bp) conducted on 6 melanoma cell lines (451Lu, 1205Lu, SKMEL5, SKMEL24, SKMEL28, WM793) treated +/- corin  (24h, 2.5uM) was used to determine if corin induces RNA splicing changes in melanoma. rMATs was used to detect SE, A5SS, A3SS, and MXE events while LeafCutter was used to detect the number of RI events. Significant events were called as: q < 0.05, deltaPSI >= |0.1|.  Then, 3 splicing events were validated based on the RNA-seq data and used to compare corin's impact on splicing to MS-275, and GSK-LSD1. Additionally, survival association analysis was conducted to determine if corin induces survival-associated splicing events.
  - `New RMATS analysis.Rmd` contains the code used to  filter raw outputs for splicing events, create the stacked bar plot, UpSet plot, heatmap, and GO dotplot for figrue 3 and contains the code used to conduct survival association analysis (TCGA-SKCM) on common corin-induced splicing events in melanoma.
  - `Splicing_Datafile.xlsx` contains the raw data for Figure 3 (significant SE splicing counts, splicing events per cell line, commone SE events, significant GO pathways) and outputs for the R script.
  - `RT-PCR SKMEL5.pzfx` is the graphpad file used to quantify and do statistical analysis for the RT-PCR gels.
  - `scripts` directory contains the rMATs and LeafCutter bash scripts run in linus
  - `raw_splicing_files` directory contains the raw outputs for rMATs and LeafCutter pre-filtering (directly outputs from scripts)
