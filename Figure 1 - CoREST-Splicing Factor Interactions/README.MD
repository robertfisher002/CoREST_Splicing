## Figure 1 - CoREST proteomcis and CoREST-SF interactions  
Here, LSD1 and RCOR1 were IP'ed in 1205Lu and 451Lu melanoma cells treated +/- corin treatment (24h, 2.5uM). Then mass spec was performed
  - `Mass_spec.Rmd` contains the code used to do GO analysis, CoREST-splicing factor identification, and volcano plots on the IP-MS data
  - `CoREST_IPMS_Datafile.xlsx` contains the raw data for Figure 1 and outputs for the R script
